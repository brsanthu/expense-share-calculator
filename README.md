Expense Share Calculator
========================

Excel file which allows you to calculate the expenses to be shared among many folks. This was started sometime back when I was in UK. We were sharing the flat and I was responsible to collect all shared expenses at the end of the month and do the accounting. Got fed up after few weeks and created this Excel file. It greatly reduced my stress at end of each month :)

=====
* Download the file https://github.com/brsanthu/expense-share-calculator/blob/master/expense-share-calculator-1.0.5.xls?raw=true
* Enter Names of folks who would be sharing the expenses
* Enter the expense entries by date, who paid them and who all going to share that expense
* At the end of it, process the calculations by clicking "Calculate Expenses"
